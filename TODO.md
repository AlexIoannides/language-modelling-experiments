# TODO

- check parameter initialisation and add from AIAYN if necessary.
- investigate gradient clipping during training.
- revisit text generation for transformer model.
- understand padding_mask in decoder.
- revisit IMDB dataset composition and associated training.
- compose notebook demonstrating transformer output at each step and relation to task.
- implement training loop for fine-tuning.
- fine-tune the generative/foundation RNN.
