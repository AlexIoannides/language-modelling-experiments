# TODO

- implement training loop text gneration.
- implement an RNN network for predicting the next word in a sentence (adapt the character level model from book).
- implement GPU acceleration for M1 Macs.
- demonstrate how to use the generative model to create new text passages.
- implement training loop for fine-tuning.
- fine-tune the generative/foundation RNN.
