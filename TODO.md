# TODO

1. implement `modelling.data.FilmReviewDataset` to feed `torch.utils.data.DatasLoader`.
2. implement `modelling.data.BasePreProcessor` to output fully tokenized batches for training.
3. implement an RNN network for predicting the next word in a sentence (adapt the character level model from book).
4. implement training loop for RNN model and test it.
5. implement GPU acceleration for M1 Macs.
6. demonstrate how to use the model to create new text passages.
