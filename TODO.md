# TODO

- implement `modelling.data.BasePreProcessor` to output fully tokenized batches for training.
- implement an RNN network for predicting the next word in a sentence (adapt the character level model from book).
- implement training loop for RNN model and test it.
- implement GPU acceleration for M1 Macs.
- demonstrate how to use the model to create new text passages.
